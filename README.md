## ðŸ’¡ Why Develop It?

- The **Vue Hooks** version of **Lomind** also depends significantly on the functionalities of **Lomind**, providing a range of practical **Vue Hooks** utilities.
- In `Vue` development, deciding whether a function should be a `hook` or a conventional function is often a tough choice. Each implementation has its own benefits in varying contexts. `Lomind` seeks to resolve this hesitation, offering a versatile solution that enables developers to choose freely according to their needs. Whether you want to use `hooks` for enhanced state and side effects management or prefer the clarity and intuitiveness of traditional functions, `Lomind` meets your needs. In essence, `Lomind` provides developers with true freedom in their development journey, simplifying the decision-making process!
